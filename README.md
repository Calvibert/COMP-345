# COMP 345: Advanced Program Design with C++
This repository contains the 4 assignments completed for the class.
The objectives of the assignments, which built upon each other, was to build a system which indexed documents that could be queried for similarity. 

An application for the program which was envisaged is to provide a list of movies with information such as a basic description, and have the user enter a movie from the list. The system would then provide recommendations of similar movies.
